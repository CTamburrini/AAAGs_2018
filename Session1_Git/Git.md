## 1. What is Version Control 

Version controls refers to a system that lets you track changes to a file or set of files. 

Over time, earlier versions of these files are able to be recalled at future time points. 

For version control here, this will be a brief introduction to Git. 

Every time you save the state of a project, Git takes a snapshot of what all your files look like at that moment and stores that snapshot as a  reference.

Git commits allow past versions of analyses to be reproduced and rolled back.

Git helps keep track of important changes to code.

Git helps maintain continuity in a project as well as a record of project history.
